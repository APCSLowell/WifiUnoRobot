Arduino Uno Wifi Robot
======================

My Arduino Uno Wifi project would be to mount the Uno Wifi in [Parallax Arduino Robot Chassis](https://www.parallax.com/product/130-35000) and write an app (probably in [Processing](https://processing.org/) but maybe using the [Corona SDK](https://coronalabs.com/products/corona-sdk/)) to control the robot over wifi via a smart phone.
