Arduino Uno Wifi Robot
======================

My Arduino Uno Wifi project would be to mount the Uno Wifi in (Parallax Arduino Robot Chassis)[https://www.parallax.com/product/130-35000} and write an app (probably in (Processing)[https://processing.org/] but maybe the (Corona SDK)[https://coronalabs.com/products/corona-sdk/]) to control the robot via a smart phone.
